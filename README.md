# Applying Probabilistic Programming to Affective Computing

This code repository contains example code to accompany "Applying Probabilistic Programming to Affective Computing" by Desmond C. Ong, Harold Soh, Jamil Zaki, and Noah D. Goodman (submitted).



*This repo is still under constructions, and we aim to have it ready by June 24, 2018.*


- [Getting Started](gettingStarted.md)
- [Introduction to Probabilistic Programming for Affective Computing](LINK) (Under construction! Will be up soon)
- [Example 1: Linear Regression](code/LinearRegression.ipynb) as a model of Appraisal (some code here, more will up soon)
- [Example 2: Semisupervised VAE](LINK) to learn to recognize faces (Under construction! Will be up soon)
- [Example 3: Multimodal VAE](LINK) to model latent affect (Under construction! Will be up soon)
