# Applying Probabilistic Programming to Affective Computing

This code repository contains example code to accompany "Applying Probabilistic Programming to Affective Computing" by Desmond C. Ong, Harold Soh, Jamil Zaki, and Noah D. Goodman (submitted).



*This repo is still under construction, and we aim to have it ready by June 24, 2018.*
